## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project explores space mission data to uncover:
- Key trends in **budget allocation**, **success rate**, and **mission duration**
- **Country-wise** and **technology-wise** performance
- **Outlier detection**, **probability analysis**, and **statistical measures**
- Visual insights on **missions, collaborations, and environmental impact**

---

## ðŸ“Š Techniques and Concepts Applied

**Descriptive Statistics**
- Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range  
- Outlier detection using IQR  
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib  

**Inferential Statistics**
- Classical probability  
- Empirical probability  
- Conditional & Joint probability  
- Independence and addition/multiplication rules  

**Visualization**
- Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots, Barplots, Pie charts  
- Probability vs Mean comparison plots  
- Country and Technology performance comparisons
